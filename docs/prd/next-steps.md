# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

The UI/UX design goals have been documented in this PRD. If detailed wireframes, user flows, or design system specifications are needed, engage the UX Expert with:

"Review the PRD at docs/prd.md and create wireframes for the Shell UI focusing on: (1) tenant selection interface, (2) dashboard listing page, and (3) JWT debug panel. Prioritize architectural demonstration over polished aesthetics, ensuring the token exchange flow is visually clear to technical stakeholders."

## Architect Prompt

The architecture document at docs/architecture.md provides comprehensive technical specifications. With the PRD now complete, you can begin implementation:

"The PRD is complete at docs/prd.md. Begin implementation starting with Epic 1 (Foundation & Shared Configuration). Focus on:
1. Setting up the monorepo structure with shared-config module
2. Creating the database schema and seed scripts
3. Establishing Docker Compose orchestration
4. Implementing health check endpoints

Reference the architecture document at docs/architecture.md for detailed technical specifications. All requirements, epics, and acceptance criteria are defined in the PRD."
