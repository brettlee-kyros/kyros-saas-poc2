# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Validate the JWT token exchange mechanism for hard tenant isolation in a multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Prove that embedded Plotly Dash applications can securely access tenant-scoped data through reverse proxy header injection
- Demonstrate consistent JWT validation across multiple services (FastAPI, Dash apps) using shared configuration
- Create a working PoC that showcases the full authentication flow: mock login → tenant selection → token exchange → dashboard embedding
- Document PoC simplifications and provide clear migration path to production MVP
- Establish foundation patterns (token exchange, reverse proxy, tenant isolation) that transition directly to MVP with infrastructure substitutions

## Background Context

The Kyros PoC addresses a critical validation need before committing to full MVP development. The existing architecture documentation (found in `existing-architecture-docs/`) proposes a sophisticated multi-tenant SaaS platform using JWT token exchange for tenant isolation. However, the core mechanisms—converting multi-tenant user tokens to single-tenant scoped tokens, passing these securely to embedded applications, and enforcing hard tenant isolation—have never been implemented or validated.

The brainstorming session identified "architectural fidelity with pragmatic mocking" as the guiding principle. This PoC will prove the architecture works by implementing production-realistic patterns (JWT exchange, reverse proxy, shared configuration) while mocking external dependencies (Azure AD B2C, cloud storage, observability). The critical validation point is demonstrating that tenant isolation works through JWT claims, preventing any cross-tenant data leakage while maintaining a seamless user experience across Shell UI and embedded Dash applications.
