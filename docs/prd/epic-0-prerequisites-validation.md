# Epic 0: Prerequisites & External Dependency Validation

**Epic Goal:** Validate all external dependencies, verify sample Plotly repositories accessibility and compatibility, and establish baseline prerequisites before beginning foundation work - ensuring Epic 4 Dash integration is not blocked by missing or incompatible external resources.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must complete before Epic 1
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Dependencies:** None (prerequisite epic)
**Blocks:** Epic 1, Epic 4

## Story 0.1: Verify Sample Plotly Repositories Accessibility

**As a** developer,
**I want** to verify access to sample-plotly-repos and validate repository structure,
**So that** Epic 4 Dash integration has confirmed access to source Dash applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Verify `sample-plotly-repos/burn-performance` repository exists and is accessible (local directory or git repo)
2. Verify `sample-plotly-repos/mixshift` repository exists and is accessible
3. Document repository locations in `docs/external-dependencies.md` with access instructions
4. Verify burn-performance contains a runnable Dash application (app.py or similar entry point)
5. Verify mixshift contains a runnable Dash application
6. Document Dash app structure (entry point file, dependencies, data loading patterns)
7. If repositories not accessible, document fallback plan (create stub Dash apps or acquire repos)
8. Create `docs/external-dependencies.md` tracking all external resources

**Definition of Done:**
- Both repositories accessible and documented
- Dash application entry points identified
- Fallback plan documented if repos unavailable

## Story 0.2: Validate Test Data Compatibility

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate test data format and structure from sample repos,
**So that** mock data preparation in Epic 4 has verified compatible source data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Verify `burn-performance-test-data/` directory exists with data files
2. Verify `mixshift-test-data/` directory exists with data files
3. Inspect data file formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.) and document in `docs/external-dependencies.md`
4. Load sample data files into Pandas DataFrames and verify successful parsing
5. Document data schemas (column names, types, sample row counts) for each dataset
6. Identify columns that will need tenant_id augmentation for multi-tenant filtering
7. Verify data files contain sufficient records for meaningful visualization (>20 rows recommended)
8. If test data missing or incompatible, create synthetic test data with documented schema
9. Document data preparation steps required for Epic 4, Story 4.1

**Definition of Done:**
- Test data locations documented
- Data schemas inspected and documented
- Tenant_id augmentation requirements identified
- Synthetic data creation plan if needed

## Story 0.3: Dash Application Startup Validation

**As a** developer,
**I want** to verify Dash applications can start without immediate errors,
**So that** Epic 4 modifications have a working baseline to build upon.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Create Python virtual environment with Python 3.11+
2. Install dependencies for burn-performance Dash app (if requirements.txt exists, use it; otherwise document dependencies)
3. Attempt to start burn-performance Dash app: `python app.py` or equivalent
4. Document startup success or failure in `docs/external-dependencies.md`
5. If startup fails, document error messages and potential fixes
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for mixshift Dash app
7. Verify Dash apps accessible at default ports (typically 8050, 8051)
8. Take screenshots of running Dash applications and save to `docs/assets/dash-baseline/`
9. Document Dash versions used (Dash, Plotly, dash-bootstrap-components if present)
10. Document any incompatibilities with Python 3.11+ or specified Dash 2.18+ version
11. If apps fail to start, create minimal working Dash apps as substitutes with documented visualization types

**Definition of Done:**
- Both Dash apps tested for startup
- Success or failure documented with error details
- Baseline screenshots captured
- Dash version compatibility confirmed

## Story 0.4: Development Environment Prerequisites Validation

**As a** developer,
**I want** to verify all required development tools are available and properly versioned,
**So that** Epic 1 setup does not encounter environment issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Verify Node.js version 20+ installed: `node --version`
2. Verify npm version 10+ installed: `npm --version`
3. Verify Python version 3.11+ installed: `python --version`
4. Verify Docker version 24+ installed: `docker --version`
5. Verify Docker Compose version 2.29+ installed: `docker-compose --version` or `docker compose version`
6. Test Docker daemon is running: `docker ps` succeeds
7. Verify git installed and accessible: `git --version`
8. Document all tool versions in `docs/environment-setup.md`
9. Create `scripts/validate-environment.sh` script that checks all prerequisites
10. Script exits with error code if any prerequisite fails, success code if all pass
11. Document installation instructions for missing prerequisites in `docs/environment-setup.md`

**Definition of Done:**
- All prerequisites validated
- Validation script created
- Installation instructions documented
- Environment ready for Epic 1

## Story 0.5: External Dependency Risk Assessment

**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** a documented risk assessment of external dependencies,
**So that** the team understands fallback options if dependencies become unavailable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `docs/external-dependencies.md` includes risk assessment section
2. For each external dependency (burn-performance, mixshift, test data), document:
   - Current availability status (accessible/inaccessible)
   - Criticality (critical/important/nice-to-have)
   - Fallback option if unavailable
   - Estimated effort to implement fallback
3. Document decision: Use actual repos or create stub Dash apps for PoC
4. If using stub apps, document simplified visualization plan (e.g., simple bar chart with mock data)
5. Update Epic 4 stories with confirmed approach (modify actual repos vs. create stub apps)
6. Product Owner sign-off on approach documented in risk assessment
7. Create `docs/assets/` directory structure for screenshots and reference materials

**Definition of Done:**
- Risk assessment complete
- Approach decision documented
- Product Owner approval received
- Epic 4 approach confirmed

## Epic 0 Exit Criteria

**PASS Criteria:**
- All external dependencies accessible OR fallback plan documented and approved
- Development environment validated on at least one machine
- Dash app startup validated OR stub app creation plan approved
- Risk assessment complete with Product Owner sign-off
