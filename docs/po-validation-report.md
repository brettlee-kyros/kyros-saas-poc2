---

### 3. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (70% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 2

#### 3.1 Third-Party Services

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - No third-party services required for PoC (mock auth eliminates Azure AD B2C)
✅ **PASS** - No API keys needed (all services local)
N/A - Credential storage not applicable (mock auth)
N/A - Fallback options not needed (no external services)

**Evidence:** PRD explicitly documents "mock authentication" (FR1) and "no cloud infrastructure" (NFR2). All dependencies are local.

#### 3.2 External APIs

❌ **FAIL** - **CRITICAL BLOCKER #2:** Integration points with Dash apps from `sample-plotly-repos` not validated for existence

**Missing:** PRD assumes existence of:
- `sample-plotly-repos/burn-performance` → CLV dashboard
- `sample-plotly-repos/mixshift` → Risk dashboard
- `burn-performance-test-data/` directory
- `mixshift-test-data/` directory

**Recommendation:** Add to Epic 1 or Epic 4:
- Story 0.1: "Verify sample-plotly-repos existence and compatibility"
  - AC: Clone or verify access to burn-performance and mixshift repos
  - AC: Verify test data directories exist and contain compatible data formats
  - AC: Document any incompatibilities or modifications needed

#### 3.3 Infrastructure Services

✅ **PASS** - No cloud resources needed (PoC runs locally per NFR2)
✅ **PASS** - No DNS/domain registration needed
✅ **PASS** - No email/messaging services
✅ **PASS** - No CDN (local static assets)

**Evidence:** PRD Technical Assumptions explicitly state "Local Deployment Only" and "No Cloud Infrastructure."

---

### 4. UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS [[UI/UX ONLY]]

**Status:** ✅ PASS (85% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 0

#### 4.1 Design System Setup

✅ **PASS** - UI framework selected (Next.js 14+, React 18+) in Story 1.6
✅ **PASS** - Design system established (Tailwind CSS 3.4+, Headless UI 2.1+)
✅ **PASS** - Styling approach defined (Tailwind utility-first)
✅ **PASS** - Responsive design strategy established (desktop-first, basic responsive per PRD)
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Accessibility requirements defined as out of scope (documented tradeoff in PRD)

**Evidence:** Story 1.6 establishes Tailwind CSS. PRD UI Design Goals section explicitly states "Accessibility: None - out of scope for PoC."

#### 4.2 Frontend Infrastructure

✅ **PASS** - Frontend build pipeline configured in Story 1.6 (Next.js built-in bundler)
✅ **PASS** - Asset optimization via Next.js defaults (Turbopack/Webpack)
✅ **PASS** - Frontend testing framework setup in Epic 6, Story 6.3 (Vitest + RTL)
✅ **PASS** - Component development workflow established (TypeScript, ESLint in Story 1.6)

**Evidence:** Story 1.6 AC #5-6 configure TypeScript and ESLint. Story 1.6 AC #9 verifies build works.

#### 4.3 User Experience Flow

✅ **PASS** - User journeys mapped (PRD UI Design Goals - Core Screens and Views)
✅ **PASS** - Navigation patterns defined (explicit tenant selection, dashboard listing, embed view)
✅ **PASS** - Error states planned (Epic 5, Story 5.3 - token expiry handling)
✅ **PASS** - Form validation patterns established (Story 3.1 AC #11 - email validation)

**Evidence:** PRD Section "Core Screens and Views" maps complete user journey: Login → Tenant Selection → Dashboard Listing → Dashboard View → Error States.

---

### 5. USER/AGENT RESPONSIBILITY

**Status:** ✅ PASS (100% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 0

#### 5.1 User Actions

✅ **PASS** - User responsibilities limited to human-only tasks (login with email, tenant selection)
✅ **PASS** - No account creation on external services (mock auth)
✅ **PASS** - No purchasing/payment actions
✅ **PASS** - No credential provision needed (pre-generated JWTs)

**Evidence:** All user actions are UI interactions (form input, button clicks). No external account creation or credentials required per mock authentication approach.

#### 5.2 Developer Agent Actions

✅ **PASS** - All code-related tasks assigned to developer agents (Epic stories use "As a developer")
✅ **PASS** - Automated processes identified (seed scripts, Docker Compose)
✅ **PASS** - Configuration management assigned appropriately (setup scripts, environment files)
✅ **PASS** - Testing and validation assigned to agents (Epic 6 stories)

**Evidence:** User stories distinguish between "As a user" (UI interactions) and "As a developer" (implementation tasks). No ambiguous responsibility.

---

### 6. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (80% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 1

#### 6.1 Functional Dependencies

✅ **PASS** - Features sequenced correctly (Epic 1 foundation → Epic 2 auth → Epic 3 UI → Epic 4 Dash → Epic 5 integration → Epic 6 testing)
✅ **PASS** - Shared components built first (shared-config in Epic 1 before use in Epic 2+)
✅ **PASS** - User flows follow logical progression (login → tenant select → dashboard)
✅ **PASS** - Authentication precedes protected features (Epic 2 before Epic 3/4/5)

**Evidence:** Epic sequence demonstrates clear dependency chain. No epic requires functionality from later epics.

#### 6.2 Technical Dependencies

✅ **PASS** - Lower-level services first (database, shared config before APIs)
✅ **PASS** - Libraries/utilities before use (shared-config before JWT validation)
✅ **PASS** - Data models defined early (Pydantic models in shared-config, Epic 1)
✅ **PASS** - API endpoints before client consumption (Epic 2 APIs before Epic 3 UI calls them)

**Evidence:** Epic 1 (foundation) → Epic 2 (backend APIs) → Epic 3 (frontend consumers) follows proper technical layering.

#### 6.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Most epic dependencies satisfied
❌ **FAIL** - **CRITICAL BLOCKER #3:** Epic 4 (Dash App Integration) depends on mock data preparation (Story 4.1) that references external repos not validated for existence

**Issue:** Story 4.1 AC #1 states: "Existing test data from sample-plotly-repos/burn-performance-test-data/ and mixshift-test-data/ copied to data/mock-data/"

This creates a blocker for Epic 4 if these directories don't exist or contain incompatible formats.

**Recommendation:** Move mock data validation to Epic 1 or create Epic 0 prerequisite story to verify external dependencies.

---

### 7. RISK MANAGEMENT [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]]

**Status:** N/A (Skipped - Greenfield project)

All subsections skipped:
- 7.1 Breaking Change Risks - N/A
- 7.2 Rollback Strategy - N/A
- 7.3 User Impact Mitigation - N/A

**Note:** While this section is brownfield-specific, the PoC does have some **greenfield-specific risks** not captured by checklist:

⚠️ **Identified Greenfield Risks (not checklist items):**
1. Dash app modification complexity unknown (burn-performance and mixshift may be difficult to modify for JWT validation)
2. Reverse proxy header injection may not work as expected with Dash's internal routing
3. Mock data may not be realistic enough to demonstrate multi-tenant filtering

**Recommendation:** While not blocking, consider adding risk mitigation stories:
- Epic 4: Add spike story to evaluate Dash app modification effort
- Epic 5: Add integration test to verify header injection before dashboard embed page

---

### 8. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT

**Status:** ✅ PASS (95% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 0

#### 8.1 Core Goals Alignment

✅ **PASS** - Error scenarios handled (401/403 responses, Epic 2 error codes)
✅ **PASS** - UX considerations included (debug panel in Epic 3, Story 3.5)

**Evidence:** Epic 3 (UI) + Epic 5 (integration) cover complete user journey with error handling.

#### 8.3 Technical Requirements

✅ **PASS** - All technical constraints from PRD addressed (monorepo, Docker Compose, mock auth)
✅ **PASS** - Non-functional requirements incorporated (NFR1-8 mapped to stories)
✅ **PASS** - Architecture decisions align with constraints (SQLite, in-memory data)
✅ **PASS** - Performance considerations addressed (NFR5: token exchange <500ms)

**Evidence:** PRD NFR section lists 8 non-functional requirements. All traceable to epic stories or architecture decisions.

---

### 9. DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (75% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 1

#### 9.1 Developer Documentation

✅ **PASS** - API documentation via FastAPI auto-generated docs (Story 1.5 AC #9)
✅ **PASS** - Setup instructions comprehensive (Architecture Section 12, README in Story 1.1)
✅ **PASS** - Architecture decisions documented (Architecture document, PRD Technical Assumptions)
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Patterns and conventions documented in Architecture Section 16 (Coding Standards)

**Evidence:** Comprehensive architecture and PRD documents exist. README setup in Story 1.1.

#### 9.2 User Documentation

❌ **FAIL** - **CRITICAL BLOCKER #4:** User guides not addressed in any story (appropriate for PoC, but stakeholder demo instructions missing)

**Missing:** No story covers:
- Stakeholder demo script (how to demonstrate the PoC)
- User walkthrough of the debug panel (key validation tool)
- Explanation of what the PoC demonstrates vs. what's mocked

**Recommendation:** Add to Epic 6 or create final wrap-up story:
- Story 6.5: "PoC Demonstration Documentation"
  - AC: Create demo script showing login → tenant select → dashboard → debug panel
  - AC: Document what's proven (JWT exchange) vs. what's mocked (auth, storage)
  - AC: Provide troubleshooting guide for common demo issues

#### 9.3 Knowledge Transfer

✅ **PASS** - Code review knowledge implied by GitHub-based development
✅ **PASS** - Deployment knowledge in Architecture Section 12 (Docker Compose commands)
N/A - Historical context (new greenfield project)

**Evidence:** Architecture Section 12.3 provides operational commands. No historical context needed for greenfield.

---

### 10. POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS

**Status:** ✅ PASS (90% complete)
**Critical Issues:** 0

#### 10.1 Future Enhancements

✅ **PASS** - Clear MVP vs future separation (Architecture Appendix: "PoC vs MVP Migration Checklist")
✅ **PASS** - Architecture supports enhancements (modular design, PostgreSQL-compatible schema)
✅ **PASS** - Technical debt documented (PRD NFR3, Architecture Section 4.8 "PoC vs MVP Data Model Tradeoffs")
✅ **PASS** - Extensibility points identified (router separation, database migration path)

**Evidence:** Architecture Appendix provides comprehensive 33-item migration checklist for MVP.

#### 10.2 Monitoring & Feedback

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Analytics/tracking not required for PoC (documented as out of scope)
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - User feedback not applicable (internal stakeholder demo)
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Monitoring addressed minimally (stdout logging only per Architecture Section 18)
✅ **PASS** - Performance measurement via test assertions (Epic 6 tests)

**Evidence:** Architecture Section 18 (Monitoring and Observability) explicitly states "None (PoC)" for most monitoring. Stdout logging sufficient for demo purposes.

---

## Critical Deficiencies Summary

### CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Development)

1. **[Section 1.4] Dependency Conflicts Not Documented**
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Could cause hours of debugging during Epic 1 setup
   - **Fix:** Add Story 1.7 or expand Story 1.2 to document dependency resolution, lock files, and troubleshooting
   - **Effort:** 2-4 hours (research + documentation)

2. **[Section 3.2] External Dependencies Not Validated**
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Epic 4 blocked if sample-plotly-repos don't exist or are incompatible
   - **Fix:** Create Epic 0 (Prerequisites) or add to Epic 1: Story to verify burn-performance and mixshift repos accessible and compatible
   - **Effort:** 4-8 hours (clone repos, verify data formats, test Dash app startup)

3. **[Section 6.3] Epic 4 Cross-Epic Dependency on Unvalidated External Data**
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Duplicate of #2, emphasizing sequencing issue
   - **Fix:** Move mock data validation before Epic 4 (either Epic 1 or Epic 0)
   - **Effort:** Included in #2

4. **[Section 9.2] Stakeholder Demo Documentation Missing**
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - PoC may not effectively communicate validation to stakeholders
   - **Fix:** Add Story 6.5: "PoC Demonstration Documentation" with demo script and explanatory materials
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours (write demo script, create troubleshooting guide)

### NON-CRITICAL ISSUES (Should Fix for Quality)

5. **[Section 4.1] Accessibility Explicitly Out of Scope**
   - **Impact:** LOW - Documented tradeoff, but limits demo to fully-abled stakeholders
   - **Fix:** Consider basic keyboard navigation and ARIA labels if time permits
   - **Effort:** 8-12 hours (accessibility audit + fixes)

6. **[Section 7 - Additional] Greenfield-Specific Risks Not Captured**
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Unknown complexity in Dash app modification could delay Epic 4
   - **Fix:** Add spike story to Epic 4: "Evaluate Dash App Modification Effort"
   - **Effort:** 4 hours (spike to test JWT validation in Dash)

---

## Recommendations by Priority

### IMMEDIATE (Before Epic 1)

1. **Validate External Dependencies** ✅ CRITICAL
   - Create Epic 0 or prepend to Epic 1
   - Clone sample-plotly-repos (burn-performance, mixshift)
   - Verify test data directories and formats
   - Document any incompatibilities

2. **Document Dependency Resolution** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Expand Epic 1, Story 1.2
   - Choose PyJWT vs python-jose and document rationale
   - Create requirements.txt with pinned versions
   - Test for version conflicts

### SHORT-TERM (During Epic 1-3)

3. **Add Demonstration Documentation** ⚠️ HIGH
   - Create Story 6.5 in Epic 6
   - Write stakeholder demo script
   - Document PoC validation points
   - Create troubleshooting guide

4. **Risk Mitigation Spike** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Add spike story to Epic 4
   - Evaluate Dash app modification complexity
   - Validate reverse proxy header injection pattern
   - Document findings

### LONG-TERM (Post-PoC)

5. **Accessibility Basic Compliance** 🟢 LOW
   - Consider for MVP (not PoC)
   - Basic keyboard navigation
   - ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Note in MVP migration checklist

---

## Final Decision

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

### Rationale

The Kyros PoC plan is **comprehensive, well-sequenced, and architecturally sound**. The epic structure demonstrates proper dependency management, with foundational components (shared config, database) established before dependent features. The PRD and architecture documents show meticulous planning with clear separation of PoC simplifications vs. MVP requirements.

However, **4 critical blockers prevent unconditional approval:**

1. **External dependency validation** - Epic 4 depends on sample-plotly-repos that may not exist or may be incompatible
2. **Dependency conflict resolution** - Potential version conflicts undocumented
3. **Demo documentation** - Stakeholder communication plan missing
4. (Related to #1) - Cross-epic dependency sequencing issue

These are **quick fixes** (estimated 12-20 hours total) that dramatically reduce risk of:
- Epic 4 blockage (showstopper)
- Epic 1 setup delays (frustration and schedule slip)
- Ineffective PoC demonstration (missed validation opportunity)

### Conditions for Approval

**APPROVE** implementation once:

✅ **Condition 1:** Epic 0 or Epic 1 prepended with story validating sample-plotly-repos existence and compatibility
✅ **Condition 2:** Epic 1, Story 1.2 expanded to document dependency resolution strategy and version locking
✅ **Condition 3:** Epic 6 includes Story 6.5 for stakeholder demo documentation
✅ **Condition 4:** (Optional but recommended) Epic 4 includes spike story for Dash modification complexity

### Confidence Level

**Implementation Readiness:** 88% → 95% (after addressing blockers)
**Developer Clarity:** 9/10 - Stories are detailed and unambiguous
**Architecture Soundness:** 10/10 - Exceptional architecture and PRD quality
**Risk Management:** 7/10 - Improved to 9/10 after addressing external dependency risk

---

## Positive Highlights

### Exceptional Quality Areas

1. **Architecture Depth** - Rarely see PoCs with this level of architectural rigor (data models, workflows, security analysis)
2. **Documentation Ecosystem** - PRD + Architecture + Test Architecture + Epic definitions form cohesive system
3. **PoC Simplification Transparency** - Explicit documentation of what's mocked and MVP migration path
4. **Shared Configuration Pattern** - Solving configuration drift proactively (root cause from brainstorming)
5. **Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive test architecture document with risk-based approach
6. **Epic Sequencing** - Clear dependency chain with proper layering

### Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Type Safety** - TypeScript frontend, Pydantic backend
- **Idempotent Operations** - Seed scripts can run multiple times safely
- **Consistent Error Formats** - Standardized API error responses
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear epic boundaries, modular design
- **Security-First** - JWT validation, deny-by-default tenancy, HTTP-only cookies

## Appendix A: Detailed Finding References

### Critical Blocker #1 Details
**Location:** Epic 1, Story 1.2 and Story 1.4
**Current Text:** "Each Python app (api, dash-app-clv, dash-app-risk) has requirements.txt with dependency specifications"
**Issue:** No validation of compatible versions or conflict resolution
**Specific Conflicts:**
- PyJWT 2.8+ vs python-jose 3.3+ (both JWT libraries, choose one)
- Dash 2.18+ with Python 3.11+ (verify compatibility)
- aiosqlite with FastAPI 0.115+ async patterns

**Proposed Addition to Story 1.2 AC:**
```
AC #9: Dependency conflict resolution documented in docs/dependency-resolution.md
AC #10: requirements.txt includes pinned versions (e.g., PyJWT==2.8.0)
AC #11: Requirements tested by installing in clean virtual environment
AC #12: Known incompatibilities or workarounds documented in README
```

### Critical Blocker #2 Details
**Location:** Epic 4, Story 4.1
**Current Text:** "Existing test data from sample-plotly-repos/burn-performance-test-data/ and mixshift-test-data/ copied to data/mock-data/"
**Issue:** No verification these directories exist or are accessible
**Risk:** Epic 4 completely blocked if repos don't exist

**Proposed New Story (Epic 0 or prepend to Epic 1):**
```
Story 0.1: Verify Sample Plotly Repositories and Test Data

As a developer,
I want to verify access to sample-plotly-repos and validate data compatibility,
So that Epic 4 Dash integration is not blocked by missing or incompatible external dependencies.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Clone or verify access to sample-plotly-repos/burn-performance repository
2. Clone or verify access to sample-plotly-repos/mixshift repository
3. Verify burn-performance-test-data/ directory exists with CSV/Parquet files
4. Verify mixshift-test-data/ directory exists with CSV/Parquet files
5. Inspect data schemas and document required columns for tenant_id augmentation
6. Test Dash app startup for both burn-performance and mixshift (verify no immediate errors)
7. Document any incompatibilities or required modifications in docs/external-dependencies.md
8. If repos not accessible, create stub Dash apps with minimal visualizations instead
```

### Critical Blocker #3 Details
(See Blocker #2 - same issue from sequencing perspective)

### Critical Blocker #4 Details
**Location:** Epic 6 or new final epic
**Issue:** No user-facing documentation for stakeholders to understand PoC validation
**Impact:** PoC may successfully work but fail to communicate architectural validation

**Proposed New Story (Epic 6):**
```
Story 6.5: PoC Demonstration Documentation

As a stakeholder,
I want clear documentation explaining what the PoC demonstrates and how to interpret results,
So that I can understand the architectural validation and make informed MVP decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. docs/demo-script.md created with step-by-step demonstration walkthrough
2. Demo script includes: login flow, tenant selection, dashboard viewing, debug panel usage
3. Document explains what's proven (JWT exchange, tenant isolation) vs. what's mocked (auth, storage)
4. Troubleshooting guide for common demo issues (Docker not starting, database not seeded, etc.)
5. Architecture validation checklist: "This PoC proves: [list of architectural validations]"
6. Screenshots or GIFs showing key validation points (debug panel with JWT claims, etc.)
7. FAQ section answering: "Why mock auth?", "How does this relate to MVP?", "What's next?"
```
