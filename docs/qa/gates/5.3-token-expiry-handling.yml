  tests_reviewed: 15 # Full Test Suite 8 (Tests 8.10-8.15 for token refresh)

  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # 10/11 ACs (AC 11 E2E test deferred)

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security design: proactive refresh 5min before expiry, JWT exp claim usage, debouncing, proper cleanup, token lifecycle management. User token validated during refresh. No token leakage in logs or errors.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Highly efficient: minimal overhead (single timer per page), JWT decode <1ms, proactive refresh prevents failed requests, module-level toast state avoids re-renders. Network: one exchange per 25min (acceptable).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling: refresh success with toast, refresh failure with redirect, user token expiry with login redirect. Timer cleanup prevents memory leaks. Graceful degradation with user guidance.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean hook-based architecture: composable, testable, reusable. Toast module-level state avoids React context complexity. Well-documented with clear intent. TypeScript strict typing.'

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: 'Add E2E automated test for token expiry flow'
      refs: ['Test Suite 8.10-8.15']
      priority: 'medium'
      rationale: 'Manual tests comprehensive but automated regression tests valuable for MVP. Consider Playwright/Cypress with short-lived mock tokens.'

    - action: 'Implement return URL preservation for post-login redirect'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts:124', 'apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts:151']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Enhances UX by returning user to original page after re-auth. Acceptable to defer for PoC.'

    - action: 'Add user notification before token expires (countdown toast)'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts:66']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Gives user warning before automatic refresh. Low priority since proactive refresh is seamless.'

    - action: 'Implement refresh retry with exponential backoff'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts:142-155']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Handles transient network failures gracefully. Current single-attempt acceptable for PoC.'

    - action: 'Add token refresh metrics/telemetry'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts:104-141']
      priority: 'medium'
      rationale: 'Track refresh success rate, timing, failures for observability. Critical for production monitoring.'

    - action: 'Consider service worker for background token refresh'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Enables refresh even when user not actively viewing dashboard. Advanced feature for MVP.'

strengths:
  - 'Proactive token refresh prevents expiry before it occurs (superior UX)'
  - 'Clean hook-based architecture: composable, testable, reusable'
  - 'Comprehensive toast system with module-level state (no prop drilling)'
  - 'Excellent error handling: all failure scenarios covered with user guidance'
  - 'Security-conscious: JWT decoding, proper cleanup, debouncing, no leakage'
  - 'Seamless integration with Stories 5.1 (proxy 401) and 5.2 (hook usage)'
  - 'Timer-based refresh with JWT exp claim is precise and efficient'
  - 'Cleanup on unmount prevents memory leaks'
  - 'Debouncing prevents concurrent refresh attempts'
  - 'Proxy 401 detection with standardized TOKEN_EXPIRED error'

integration_points:
  - story: '5.1'
    status: 'VERIFIED'
    notes: 'Proxy enhanced to detect 401 from Dash apps. Returns standardized TOKEN_EXPIRED error.'

  - story: '5.2'
    status: 'VERIFIED'
    notes: 'useTokenRefresh hook integrated into dashboard embedding page. Proactive refresh works seamlessly.'

  - story: '3.2'
    status: 'VERIFIED'
    notes: 'Auth context provides user token. Zustand tenant store provides tenant token. Both used by refresh hook.'

architectural_highlights:
  - decision: 'Proactive refresh over reactive error handling'
    rationale: 'Prevents most expiry scenarios before they occur. Superior UX with minimal user disruption.'
    impact: 'Users rarely see token expiry errors. Session extends automatically without interruption.'

  - decision: 'Hook-based approach over global fetch override'
    rationale: 'Selective usage (only dashboard pages), no performance penalty on all requests, more maintainable.'
    impact: 'Clean architecture, testable, composable, no global side effects.'

  - decision: 'Module-level toast state over React context'
    rationale: 'Simpler implementation, no unnecessary re-renders, global access without prop drilling.'
    impact: 'Efficient notification system with minimal React complexity.'

  - decision: 'JWT exp claim for refresh timing'
    rationale: 'Precise timing, no client clock manipulation, uses existing token data.'
    impact: 'Reliable refresh scheduling immune to client-side clock changes.'

deferred_items:
  - item: 'Return URL preservation (AC 4,6 partial)'
    reason: 'Acceptable for PoC - current redirect to home/tenant selection is sufficient'
    recommendation: 'Implement for MVP to enhance user experience after re-auth'

  - item: 'E2E automated test (AC 11)'
    reason: 'Manual Test Suite 8 comprehensive for PoC validation'
    recommendation: 'Add Playwright/Cypress tests for MVP regression testing'

  - item: 'Global fetch interceptor'
    reason: 'Not needed with proactive refresh approach - most expiry prevented before occurrence'
    recommendation: 'Maintain current hook-based approach for better architecture'
