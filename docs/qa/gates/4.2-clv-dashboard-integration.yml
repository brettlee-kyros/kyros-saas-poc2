  pattern_checklist:
    - requirement: "auth_middleware.py must be identical between CLV and Risk apps"
      rationale: "Single source of truth for authentication logic"

    - requirement: "data_client.py differs only in default dashboard slug parameter"
      rationale: "Consistent data fetching pattern across dashboards"

    - requirement: "error_page.py must be identical"
      rationale: "Consistent error UX across dashboards"

    - requirement: "Dockerfile differs only in port number (8050 vs 8051)"
      rationale: "Consistent containerization pattern"

    - requirement: "requirements.txt must be identical"
      rationale: "Consistent dependency versions prevent compatibility issues"

reviewer_notes:
  summary: |
    Story 4.2 implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with comprehensive
    documentation, robust error handling, and proper security practices. The hard tenant
    isolation requirement is fully satisfied through thread-local storage and JWT validation
    on every request. Minor concerns around hardcoded configuration values are acceptable
    for POC stage but should be addressed before production.

  highlights:
    - "Security implementation is production-grade"
    - "Error handling covers all failure scenarios gracefully"
    - "Documentation quality exceptional - clear docstrings throughout"
    - "Modular architecture facilitates maintenance and testing"

  concerns:
    - "Lack of automated tests is a significant gap for production"
    - "Performance optimization needed (caching, connection pooling)"
    - "Configuration management needs improvement (environment variables)"

  next_steps:
    - "Proceed with Story 4.3 review using 4.2 as pattern reference"
    - "Validate cross-story consistency between CLV and Risk dashboards"
    - "Schedule integration testing session for tenant isolation verification"
    - "Plan test automation sprint to address coverage gaps"
