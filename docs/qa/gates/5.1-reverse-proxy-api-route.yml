nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security posture: SSRF protection via allowlist, server-side token injection, header whitelist, query param sanitization, no token leakage'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Acceptable for PoC (< 100 users). Minimal overhead (+2-5ms). Request timing logged. Optimizations identified for MVP (connection pooling, streaming, timeouts)'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios: 401 (missing token), 404 (invalid slug), 503 (service unavailable), 504 (timeout), 500 (generic). Proper HTTP status codes'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with separation of concerns (proxy-config module). Excellent inline documentation. TypeScript strict typing. Follows Next.js 14 App Router patterns'

recommendations:
  immediate: [] # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: 'Add automated integration tests using Playwright or Cypress'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Manual tests are comprehensive for PoC; automated tests valuable for regression testing in MVP'

    - action: 'Implement configurable request timeout'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts:132']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Currently relies on fetch defaults (~30s). Explicit timeout improves reliability at scale'

    - action: 'Add metrics/observability (request rate, latency percentiles, error rate)'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts']
      priority: 'medium'
      rationale: 'Critical for production monitoring and performance debugging'

    - action: 'Consider connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts:132']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Reusing HTTP connections reduces latency; important for MVP under load'

    - action: 'Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing Dash apps'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts:185']
      priority: 'low'
      rationale: 'Fail fast when Dash apps consistently unavailable; improves user experience'

    - action: 'Add rate limiting per user and per dashboard'
      refs: ['apps/shell-ui/app/api/proxy/dash/[...path]/route.ts']
      priority: 'medium'
      rationale: 'Prevents abuse and protects Dash app resources; critical for MVP'

strengths:
  - 'Security-first design with multiple layers of protection (SSRF, token handling, header security)'
  - 'Comprehensive error handling covering all failure modes with appropriate HTTP status codes'
  - 'Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns (proxy route + config module)'
  - 'Excellent documentation: inline comments explain WHY, not just WHAT'
  - 'Production considerations: Docker networking, environment variables, timing logs'
  - 'Token dual-source support (header + query param) elegantly handles fetch and iframe use cases'
  - 'TypeScript expertise evident (strict typing, error type narrowing)'
  - 'Configuration issue identified and resolved (Next.js rewrite blocking proxy routes)'
  - '15 comprehensive manual tests created covering all acceptance criteria'
