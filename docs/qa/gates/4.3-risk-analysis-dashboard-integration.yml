pattern_consistency_achievement:
  status: "EXEMPLARY"
  score: 100

  summary: |
    Story 4.3 demonstrates PERFECT adherence to the pattern established in Story 4.2.
    All shared modules (auth_middleware, data_client, error_page, requirements.txt) are
    IDENTICAL with zero unintended divergence. This represents best-in-class multi-dashboard
    architecture and sets the gold standard for future dashboard integrations.

  benefits:
    - "Easy maintenance: fixes to shared modules benefit all dashboards"
    - "Consistent security: single auth pattern audited once, applied everywhere"
    - "Predictable behavior: developers know what to expect across dashboards"
    - "Reduced cognitive load: pattern reuse simplifies onboarding"
    - "Future-proof: pattern proven reusable for additional dashboards"

  future_recommendations:
    - "Consider extracting shared modules to packages/dash-shared/"
    - "Document pattern in architecture guidelines"
    - "Use this pattern as template for Stories 5.x, 6.x dashboard integrations"
    - "Maintain pattern consistency as critical quality metric"

reviewer_notes:
  summary: |
    Story 4.3 implementation achieves PERFECT pattern consistency with Story 4.2,
    demonstrating exemplary adherence to established architecture. All shared modules
    are identical (verified via diff with 0 differences), with only appropriate
    dashboard-specific variations (port, slug, visualization logic). The critical
    differentiator is that both Acme AND Beta tenants have Risk data access, requiring
    additional integration testing to verify proper multi-tenant data isolation.

  highlights:
    - "PERFECT pattern consistency - all shared modules identical (0 diff lines)"
    - "Best-in-class multi-dashboard architecture achieved"
    - "Security implementation production-grade (inherited from CLV)"
    - "Error handling robust and production-ready (inherited from CLV)"
    - "Improved visualization fallback logic over CLV baseline"
    - "Sets gold standard for future dashboard integrations"

  concerns:
    - "CRITICAL: Multi-tenant data isolation not yet integration tested"
    - "Lack of automated tests (inherited from CLV, still needs addressing)"
    - "Performance optimization needed (caching, pooling - inherited from CLV)"
    - "Configuration management (environment variables - inherited from CLV)"

  critical_success_factors:
    - "Perfect pattern consistency enables maintainability at scale"
    - "Proven that the pattern is reusable across multiple dashboards"
    - "Sets precedent for future Stories 5.x, 6.x, etc."

  next_steps:
    - "Execute CRITICAL integration test for multi-tenant data isolation"
    - "Consider extracting shared modules to packages/dash-shared/"
    - "Document this pattern in architecture guidelines"
    - "Schedule test automation sprint to address coverage gaps"
    - "Use this pattern as template for future dashboard integrations"
