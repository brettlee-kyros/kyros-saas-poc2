---

## Gap Analysis

### Identified Gaps (Minor)

#### 1. **Security Testing**
**Risk Level:** Low (PoC phase acceptable)

Missing test cases:
- XSS vulnerability testing (malicious email inputs)
- CSRF protection validation
- Token injection attacks
- Session fixation testing

**Recommendation:** Add for MVP phase when security becomes critical.

#### 2. **Performance Testing**
**Risk Level:** Low (not critical for PoC)

Missing scenarios:
- Load time benchmarks (Time to Interactive)
- Large tenant list performance (100+ tenants)
- Token decode performance measurement
- API response time validation

**Recommendation:** Add performance assertions in integration tests.

#### 3. **Accessibility Testing**
**Risk Level:** Medium

Missing validation:
- WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation (Tab order, Enter key submission)
- Focus management (especially in AuthGuard redirects)
- ARIA labels and roles

**Recommendation:** Add accessibility test suite (8-10 test cases).

#### 4. **Browser Compatibility**
**Risk Level:** Low

Not specified:
- Which browsers to test (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browser testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Browser version requirements

**Recommendation:** Add browser compatibility matrix to prerequisites.

#### 5. **Concurrent User Scenarios**
**Risk Level:** Very Low (PoC acceptable)

Missing:
- Multiple browser tabs with same user
- Race conditions during token exchange
- Token refresh while using app

**Recommendation:** Defer to MVP phase.

## Test Execution Flow Analysis

### Dependency Chain Validation

**Recommended Execution Order:** ✅ Well-Designed

```
Prerequisites → Story 3.1 → Story 3.2 → Story 3.5 (parallel) → Story 3.3 → Story 3.4 → Integration
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Prerequisites** - Ensures environment is ready
2. **Story 3.1** - Login is foundation for all subsequent tests
3. **Story 3.2** - Auth context required before protected routes
4. **Story 3.5** - Debug panel can be tested in parallel with 3.3/3.4
5. **Story 3.3** - Tenant selection precedes dashboard listing
6. **Story 3.4** - Dashboard listing depends on tenant selection
7. **Integration** - Full flows validate cross-story functionality

### Test Interdependencies

| Test Case | Depends On | Blocks | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| All 3.2 tests | TC-3.1.4 (login) | 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 | Auth context must work |
| TC-3.3.4 | TC-3.2.2 (token storage) | 3.4, 3.5 | Token exchange requires stored user token |
| TC-3.4.3 | TC-3.3.4 (tenant token) | Integration | Dashboard fetch needs tenant token |
| TC-INT.1 | All story tests | None | End-to-end validation |

**Assessment:** ✅ Dependency chain is logical and well-structured.

- [ ] Focus indicators have sufficient contrast
```

#### R2: Add Browser Compatibility Matrix
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Low (documentation update)

Add to Prerequisites section:

```markdown
### Browser Support
Test in the following browsers:
- [ ] Chrome 120+ (primary)

- Expected: Token exchange completes in < 500ms
```

#### R4: Enhance Test Data Validation
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Low (documentation)

Add SQL queries to verify test data:

```sql
-- Verify mock users exist
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as tenant_count
FROM user_tenant_associations
GROUP BY email;

-- Verify dashboard assignments
SELECT t.name, COUNT(d.dashboard_id) as dashboard_count
FROM tenants t
LEFT JOIN dashboard_assignments da ON t.tenant_id = da.tenant_id
LEFT JOIN dashboards d ON da.dashboard_id = d.dashboard_id
GROUP BY t.name;
```

#### R5: Add Test Data Reset Script
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium

Create script to reset test environment between runs:

```bash
# reset-test-data.sh
docker-compose down
docker volume rm kyros-saas-poc_postgres_data
docker-compose up -d
# Wait for services to be healthy
./seed-database.sh
```

### Low Priority Recommendations

#### R6: Add Screenshot Capture Points
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Low

Mark test cases where screenshots should be captured:

- TC-3.1.2 - Login page layout
- TC-3.3.2 - Tenant selection cards
- TC-3.5.5 - Debug panel showing user token
- TC-3.5.6 - Debug panel showing tenant token

#### R7: Add API Request/Response Examples
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Low

Include sample API payloads in test cases for reference:

```json
// TC-3.1.4 - Expected Request
POST /api/auth/mock-login
{
  "email": "analyst@acme.com"
}

// Expected Response
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGci...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```
