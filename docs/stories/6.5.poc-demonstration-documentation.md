### Demo Script Template

**docs/demo-script.md outline:**

```markdown
# Kyros PoC Demonstration Script

## Overview
This demonstration validates the JWT token exchange architecture for hard tenant isolation in a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## Prerequisites

### Environment Check
- [ ] Docker Desktop running
- [ ] All containers healthy: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Database seeded: verify with `sqlite3 data/tenant_metadata.db "SELECT * FROM tenants;"`

### Test Users
| Email | Tenant Access | Role | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|------|---------|
| analyst@acme.com | Acme Corp | viewer | Single-tenant user demo |
| admin@acme.com | Acme Corp, Beta Industries | admin | Multi-tenant user demo |
| viewer@beta.com | Beta Industries | viewer | Cross-tenant isolation demo |

## Demo Flow

### Step 1: Login Flow (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Demonstrate mock authentication and user access token generation.

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Enter email: `analyst@acme.com`
3. Click "Login"
4. **Validation Point:** User redirected to dashboard listing (skips tenant selection for single-tenant user)

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Mock authentication generates valid JWT with tenant_ids array
- ✅ Single-tenant users skip tenant selection (UX optimization)

### Step 2: Tenant Selection (Multi-Tenant User) (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Demonstrate multi-tenant user workflow and token exchange.

1. Logout and login as: `admin@acme.com`
2. Observe tenant selection page with 2 tenant cards (Acme Corp, Beta Industries)
3. Click "Select" on Acme Corp card
4. **Validation Point:** User redirected to dashboard listing

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Multi-tenant users presented with tenant selection
- ✅ Token exchange triggered on tenant selection
- ✅ Tenant-scoped token generated with single tenant_id

### Step 3: Dashboard Listing (Tenant Isolation) (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Demonstrate tenant-specific dashboard filtering.

1. While logged in as admin@acme.com (Acme Corp selected):
   - Observe dashboard cards (should show 2 Acme dashboards)
   - Note: Customer Lifetime Value, Revenue Forecast
2. Switch tenant to Beta Industries
3. Observe dashboard cards (should show 1 Beta dashboard)
   - Note: Risk Analysis
4. **Validation Point:** Dashboard listing filtered by tenant_id from JWT

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Dashboard listings filtered by tenant_id from token
- ✅ No cross-tenant dashboard visibility
- ✅ Tenant isolation enforced at API layer

### Step 4: Embedded Dash App Viewing (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Demonstrate reverse proxy with server-side token injection.

1. Click on "Customer Lifetime Value" dashboard
2. Wait for Dash app to load in iframe
3. Observe Dash app content (charts, metrics)
4. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
5. Observe proxy requests to `/api/proxy/dash/*`
6. **Validation Point:** Dash app loads successfully without client-side token exposure

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Reverse proxy injects Authorization header server-side
- ✅ Client never sees or handles tenant-scoped token
- ✅ Dash app validates JWT using shared config
- ✅ Seamless embedding without CORS issues

### Step 5: Debug Panel (JWT Claims Inspection) (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Inspect JWT claims to verify token structure.

1. Click "Debug Panel" button (top-right corner)
2. Observe "User Access Token" section:
   - **Key Field:** `tenant_ids` (array: ["8e1b3d5b...", "9f2c4e6d..."])
   - Shows multi-tenant access
3. Observe "Tenant-Scoped Token" section:
   - **Key Field:** `tenant_id` (single value: "8e1b3d5b...")
   - **Key Field:** `role` ("admin")
   - Shows single-tenant scope
4. **Validation Point:** Token structure matches architectural design

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ User token contains tenant_ids array (multi-tenant access)
- ✅ Tenant-scoped token contains single tenant_id (hard isolation)
- ✅ Role information included for authorization
- ✅ Token exchange mechanism working correctly

### Step 6: Token Expiry Handling (Optional - 5 minutes)

**Objective:** Demonstrate proactive token refresh.

1. While viewing dashboard, observe token expiry countdown in debug panel
2. Wait for proactive token refresh (occurs 5 minutes before expiry)
3. Observe toast notification: "Token refreshed successfully"
4. **Validation Point:** Session continues without interruption

**What This Proves:**
- ✅ Proactive token refresh prevents expiry
- ✅ Seamless user experience (no forced logout)
- ✅ Token lifecycle management working correctly

## Proven vs. Mocked

### Proven Architectural Components ✅

| Component | What's Proven |
|-----------|---------------|
| JWT Token Exchange | Multi-tenant token → single-tenant token conversion works |
| Tenant Isolation | JWT claims enforce hard isolation (no cross-tenant access) |
| Reverse Proxy | Server-side token injection to Dash apps (no client exposure) |
| Shared Config | Centralized JWT validation prevents configuration drift |
| Authorization | Role-based access control via JWT claims |
| Token Lifecycle | Proactive refresh and expiry handling |

### Mocked Components (PoC Scope) 🔧

| Component | PoC Implementation | MVP Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Authentication | Mock email-only login | Azure AD B2C with OAuth 2.0 |
| Data Storage | In-memory SQLite | Azure SQL Database |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose (local) | Azure Container Apps / AKS |
| Multi-Region | Single local deployment | Azure Front Door + regional clusters |
| Monitoring | Console logs | Azure Monitor + Application Insights |

**Why Mocked?**
- PoC focuses on validating JWT token exchange architecture
- External integrations (Azure AD B2C) add complexity without architectural value
- Local deployment faster for iteration and validation
- MVP will integrate production services once architecture validated

## Architecture Validation Checklist

Use this checklist during the demo to verify all architectural goals:

- [ ] **JWT Token Exchange**
  - [ ] User access token contains `tenant_ids` array
  - [ ] Tenant-scoped token contains single `tenant_id` (not array)
  - [ ] Token exchange endpoint returns valid tenant-scoped token
  - [ ] Unauthorized tenant exchange returns 403

- [ ] **Tenant Isolation**
  - [ ] Dashboard listings filtered by tenant_id from JWT
  - [ ] Dashboard data filtered by tenant_id from JWT
  - [ ] Cross-tenant API calls return 403 Forbidden
  - [ ] No cross-tenant data leakage in responses

- [ ] **Reverse Proxy**
  - [ ] Authorization header injected server-side (check Dash logs)
  - [ ] Client never handles tenant-scoped token
  - [ ] Dash apps receive valid JWT in requests
  - [ ] CORS handled by proxy (no client-side CORS errors)

- [ ] **Shared Configuration**
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET consistent across Shell UI, API, and Dash apps
  - [ ] Token validation logic identical (shared_config package)
  - [ ] No configuration drift between services

- [ ] **Token Lifecycle**
  - [ ] Proactive token refresh 5 minutes before expiry
  - [ ] User token validated during refresh
  - [ ] Expired tokens redirect to login
  - [ ] Session continuity maintained

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Compose Fails to Start

**Symptoms:**
- Containers exit immediately
- Port binding errors (3000, 8050, 8051, 8052 already in use)

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Stop conflicting services
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8050 | xargs kill -9

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

### Database Not Seeded (Empty Tenant List)

**Symptoms:**
- After login, no tenant cards shown
- Error: "No tenants found for user"

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Seed database manually
python apps/api/src/database/seed.py

# Verify seeding
sqlite3 data/tenant_metadata.db "SELECT * FROM tenants;"
sqlite3 data/tenant_metadata.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

### Dash Apps Return 401 (JWT Validation Failure)

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard iframe shows "Unauthorized" error
- Proxy returns 401 from upstream Dash app

**Resolution:**
1. Verify JWT_SECRET consistent across services:
   ```bash
   # Check .env file
   grep JWT_SECRET .env

   # Verify Dash apps using shared_config
   docker-compose logs dash-clv | grep JWT
   ```

2. Restart Dash apps to pick up config changes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart dash-clv dash-forecast dash-risk
   ```

### Token Expired During Demo

**Symptoms:**
- Redirect to login page
- Error: "Token expired"

**Resolution:**
- Re-authenticate: Login again with same user
- Session will resume with refreshed tokens
- For longer demos: Increase JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES in .env

### Network Connectivity Issues Between Containers

**Symptoms:**
- Shell UI cannot reach API
- API cannot reach Dash apps

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Verify all containers on same network
docker network ls
docker network inspect kyros-saas-poc_default

# Verify DNS resolution
docker-compose exec shell-ui ping api
docker-compose exec api ping dash-clv
```

## FAQ

### Why use mock authentication instead of real Azure AD B2C?

**Answer:** The PoC focuses on validating the JWT token exchange architecture, not authentication integration. Mock authentication allows rapid iteration without external dependencies. Azure AD B2C integration is planned for MVP once the core architecture is validated.

**PoC Value:** Proves JWT-based tenant isolation works independently of authentication provider.

### How does this PoC relate to MVP requirements?

**Answer:** The PoC validates the core architectural hypothesis: "JWT token exchange can enforce hard tenant isolation in a multi-tenant SaaS platform." MVP will build on this foundation by integrating production services (Azure AD B2C, Azure SQL, Azure Container Apps).

**Architecture Continuity:** JWT token exchange mechanism proven in PoC will be used in MVP without changes.

### What changes are needed to transition from PoC to MVP?

**Answer:**
1. **Authentication:** Replace mock login with Azure AD B2C OAuth 2.0 flow
2. **Storage:** Replace SQLite with Azure SQL Database
3. **Infrastructure:** Replace Docker Compose with Azure Container Apps
4. **Monitoring:** Add Azure Monitor and Application Insights
5. **Security:** Add SSL/TLS, API Gateway, WAF
6. **Data:** Replace in-memory Dash data with Azure Storage queries

**Architecture Preservation:** JWT token exchange, reverse proxy, and shared config remain unchanged.

### Can this architecture scale to production?

**Answer:** Yes, with infrastructure upgrades:
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Shell UI and API can scale independently in Azure Container Apps
- **Dash App Scaling:** Each Dash app runs as separate container (independent scaling)
- **Database Scaling:** Azure SQL Database supports enterprise-scale multi-tenancy
- **Global Distribution:** Azure Front Door enables multi-region deployment
- **Token Exchange:** Stateless JWT exchange scales linearly (no session storage)

**Performance Considerations:** JWT validation is CPU-bound (<1ms). Reverse proxy adds minimal latency (~2-5ms). Bottleneck will be Dash app data queries (addressable with caching).

### What security validations does this PoC prove?

**Answer:**
1. ✅ **Hard Tenant Isolation:** JWT claims enforce single-tenant scope (no cross-tenant access)
2. ✅ **Server-Side Token Handling:** Client never sees tenant-scoped token (reduced attack surface)
3. ✅ **Signature Validation:** Tampered JWTs rejected with 401 (verified in tests)
4. ✅ **Expiry Enforcement:** Expired tokens rejected (verified in tests)
5. ✅ **Authorization Enforcement:** Unauthorized tenant access returns 403 (verified in tests)
6. ✅ **Configuration Consistency:** Shared config prevents JWT validation drift

**Security Gaps (MVP):** SSL/TLS, rate limiting, WAF, secret rotation, audit logging.

### Architectural Validation Summary Template

**docs/architectural-validation-summary.md outline:**

```markdown
# Architectural Validation Summary

## Core Hypothesis
**Statement:** JWT token exchange can enforce hard tenant isolation in a multi-tenant SaaS platform with embedded Dash applications.

**Validation Outcome:** ✅ **PROVEN** - The architecture successfully enforces tenant isolation via JWT claims without cross-tenant data leakage.

## Validation Evidence

### 1. JWT Token Exchange Mechanism

**Evidence:**
- Unit tests (test_jwt.py): 15 tests passing (JWT encoding/decoding/validation)
- Integration tests (test_integration.py): 7 tests passing (token exchange flows)
- Manual testing: Token exchange endpoint verified with test users

**Key Findings:**
- User access token correctly encodes `tenant_ids` array
- Tenant-scoped token correctly encodes single `tenant_id` (not array)
- Token exchange validates user authorization before issuing tenant-scoped token
- Unauthorized tenant access rejected with 403

**Screenshots:**
- [Debug panel showing user token with tenant_ids array](assets/demo/user-token-debug-panel.png)
- [Debug panel showing tenant-scoped token with single tenant_id](assets/demo/tenant-token-debug-panel.png)

### 2. Tenant Isolation Enforcement

**Evidence:**
- Integration tests: Cross-tenant access returns 403 (7/7 passing)
- E2E tests: Multi-tenant user workflow validates isolation (5/5 passing)
- Manual testing: Dashboard listings and data filtered by tenant_id

**Key Findings:**
- Dashboard listings show only tenant-specific dashboards
- Dashboard data responses contain only tenant-specific records
- API endpoints enforce tenant_id matching between JWT and path parameters
- No cross-tenant data leakage observed in any test scenario

**Screenshots:**
- [Dashboard listing filtered by tenant](assets/demo/dashboard-listing.png)
- [403 error when attempting unauthorized tenant access](assets/demo/403-error-state.png)

### 3. Reverse Proxy Token Injection

**Evidence:**
- E2E tests: Dash apps load successfully with server-side token injection (3/3 passing)
- Dash app logs: Authorization headers received and validated
- Network inspection: Client never receives tenant-scoped token

**Key Findings:**
- Reverse proxy successfully injects Authorization header server-side
- Dash apps receive and validate JWTs using shared config
- Client-side code never handles tenant-scoped token (reduced attack surface)
- No CORS issues with iframe embedding

**Screenshots:**
- [Embedded Dash app loading successfully](assets/demo/embedded-dash-app.png)

### 4. Shared Configuration Prevents Drift

**Evidence:**
- Shared config package used by Shell UI, API, and Dash apps
- JWT_SECRET loaded from environment variables consistently
- JWT validation logic identical across services

**Key Findings:**
- Single source of truth for JWT validation (shared_config/jwt_utils.py)
- No configuration drift observed during testing
- Changes to JWT config automatically propagate to all services

## Risk Areas Identified

### 1. Token Refresh Race Conditions (LOW RISK)

**Description:** Concurrent token refresh attempts could cause race conditions.

**Mitigation:** Debouncing implemented in useTokenRefresh hook (Story 5.3). Single refresh timer per page.

**MVP Recommendation:** Add distributed locking for token refresh in multi-tab scenarios.

### 2. Dash App Scalability (MEDIUM RISK)

**Description:** Each Dash app runs as separate process. Scaling to 100+ tenants may require app pooling or dynamic instantiation.

**Mitigation (PoC):** Static Dash app deployment (3 apps). Sufficient for PoC validation.

**MVP Recommendation:** Implement Dash app pooling or container orchestration (AKS) for dynamic scaling.

### 3. JWT Secret Rotation (MEDIUM RISK)

**Description:** JWT_SECRET is static. Rotation requires coordinated restart of all services.

**Mitigation (PoC):** Not addressed (acceptable for PoC).

**MVP Recommendation:** Implement graceful secret rotation with dual-key validation period.

### 4. Token Storage Security (LOW RISK)

**Description:** User tokens stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS).

**Mitigation (PoC):** Client never handles tenant-scoped token (most sensitive token). User tokens have limited scope.

**MVP Recommendation:** Use httpOnly cookies for user tokens. Continue server-side handling for tenant-scoped tokens.

## Recommendations for MVP

### Architecture Preservation (Keep As-Is)
1. ✅ JWT token exchange mechanism (proven effective)
2. ✅ Reverse proxy with server-side token injection (security best practice)
3. ✅ Shared config package (prevents configuration drift)
4. ✅ Tenant-scoped token structure (single tenant_id)

### Architecture Enhancements (MVP)
1. **Authentication Integration**
   - Replace mock login with Azure AD B2C OAuth 2.0
   - Map Azure AD groups to tenant access (tenant_ids claim)

2. **Infrastructure Upgrades**
   - Deploy to Azure Container Apps (auto-scaling)
   - Use Azure SQL Database (replace SQLite)
   - Add Azure Front Door (global distribution)
   - Add Azure Monitor + Application Insights (observability)

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement JWT secret rotation
   - Use httpOnly cookies for user tokens
   - Add rate limiting and WAF
   - Enable audit logging for token exchanges

4. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Implement Dash app pooling or dynamic instantiation
   - Add Redis caching for dashboard metadata
   - Optimize database queries with indexing

5. **Operational Improvements**
   - Add health checks for all services
   - Implement graceful shutdown and restart
   - Add automated database migrations
   - Create runbooks for common operations

### Features to Defer (Post-MVP)
1. Multi-region active-active deployment
2. Custom RBAC beyond viewer/admin roles
3. Dashboard personalization and favorites
4. Advanced analytics and usage tracking
