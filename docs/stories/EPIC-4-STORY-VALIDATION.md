**Result:** ✅ Dependencies clearly documented and correct

### ✅ 6. Pattern Consistency

**Intentional Consistency (Story 4.2 ↔️ Story 4.3):**
- JWT validation middleware: IDENTICAL
- Data client pattern: NEARLY IDENTICAL (only dashboard slug differs)
- Error handling: IDENTICAL
- Docker configuration: IDENTICAL (except port: 8050 vs 8051)
- Logging format: IDENTICAL
- Testing approach: IDENTICAL

**Intentional Differences:**
- Port numbers: 8050 (CLV) vs 8051 (Risk)
- Dashboard slugs: 'customer-lifetime-value' vs 'risk-analysis'
- Tenant access: Acme-only (CLV) vs Both tenants (Risk)

**Result:** ✅ Pattern consistency is intentional and well-documented

### ✅ 7. Testing Strategy

All stories include comprehensive testing guidance:

**Story 4.1:**
- Unit tests for data_loader.load_tenant_data()
- Unit tests for tenant_id filtering
- Integration tests for data API endpoint
- Manual testing with curl commands

**Story 4.2:**
- JWT validation testing (valid, expired, invalid tokens)
- Data API integration testing
- Tenant isolation testing (Acme-only access)
- Error handling testing
- Integration test examples with pytest

**Story 4.3:**
- All Story 4.2 tests PLUS:
- Cross-tenant testing (both Acme and Beta have access)
- Data isolation verification (Acme ≠ Beta data)
- Cross-app consistency testing (diff between CLV and Risk)
- Pattern validation tests

**Result:** ✅ Testing strategies are comprehensive and specific

### ✅ 8. Security Considerations

All stories include explicit security notes:

**Common Security Requirements:**
- JWT validation on every request
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- No tokens in client-side code
- Authorization header forwarding
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

**Story-Specific Security Focus:**

**Story 4.1:** Tenant data filtering at API layer
**Story 4.2:** JWT middleware implementation, thread-local context
**Story 4.3:** Cross-tenant isolation verification (both tenants have data)

**Result:** ✅ Security requirements are explicit and thorough

### ✅ 9. Code Examples

All stories provide working code examples:

**Story 4.1:**
- Data augmentation script (Python)
- Data loader module with caching (Python)
- FastAPI endpoint with JWT validation (Python)
- Unit test examples (pytest)

**Story 4.2:**
- JWT validation middleware (Python)
- Data API client (Python)
- Dash app entry point (Python)

**Story 4.3:**
- Same code examples as Story 4.2 (demonstrating consistency)
- Cross-app comparison commands (bash diff)
- Tenant isolation test examples (pytest)

**Result:** ✅ Code examples are complete and copy-paste ready

### ✅ 10. Documentation Standards

All stories follow documentation best practices:

- Clear headings and structure
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables for structured data
- Emojis for visual markers (⚠️, ✅, ⏳)
- Inline comments in code examples
- Cross-references to other stories/epics
- Change log for versioning

## Cross-Story Consistency Validation

### Data Flow Consistency

**Story 4.1 → Story 4.2 → Story 4.3:**

```
Story 4.1: Data Preparation + API Layer
  ↓
  Creates: GET /api/dashboards/{slug}/data endpoint
  ↓
  Returns: {tenant_id, dashboard_slug, data: [...]}
  ↓
Story 4.2: CLV Dashboard Integration
  ↓
  Consumes: GET /api/dashboards/customer-lifetime-value/data
  ↓
  Validates JWT → Extracts tenant_id → Calls API → Renders visualization
  ↓
Story 4.3: Risk Dashboard Integration
  ↓
  Consumes: GET /api/dashboards/risk-analysis/data
  ↓
  IDENTICAL PATTERN to Story 4.2
```

**Result:** ✅ Data flow is consistent across all stories

### Tenant Data Distribution

| Dashboard | Acme Access | Beta Access | Story |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| CLV | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | 4.2 |
| Risk | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 4.3 |

**Data prepared in Story 4.1:**
- CLV data: Acme tenant_id only
- Risk data: Both Acme and Beta tenant_ids (60/40 split)

**Result:** ✅ Tenant distribution is consistent with requirements

### JWT Validation Pattern

All three stories use identical JWT validation approach:

1. **Story 4.1:** FastAPI dependency injection with get_tenant_from_token()
2. **Story 4.2:** Dash middleware with @require_tenant_token decorator
3. **Story 4.3:** Identical to Story 4.2

**Result:** ✅ JWT validation pattern is consistent

### Error Handling

All stories handle errors consistently:

- **401:** Invalid/expired JWT
- **404:** Dashboard not found or no data for tenant
- **500:** Unexpected errors with logging

**Result:** ✅ Error handling is consistent

---

## Issues Found

### ❌ None

No issues, gaps, or inconsistencies found during validation.

## Recommendations

### 1. Story Execution Order

**Recommended sequence:**
1. **Story 4.1** (Data API) - MUST be completed first
2. **Story 4.2** (CLV Dashboard) - Establishes the pattern
3. **Story 4.3** (Risk Dashboard) - Follows the pattern

**Rationale:**
- Story 4.1 provides the data API that both dashboards depend on
- Story 4.2 establishes the Dash integration pattern
- Story 4.3 validates pattern consistency

### 2. Pattern Consistency Enforcement

After Story 4.2 and 4.3 are complete:

**Validate consistency:**
```bash
# Compare middleware
diff apps/dash-app-clv/auth_middleware.py apps/dash-app-risk/auth_middleware.py

# Compare data client
diff apps/dash-app-clv/data_client.py apps/dash-app-risk/data_client.py

# Compare error pages
diff apps/dash-app-clv/error_page.py apps/dash-app-risk/error_page.py
```

**Expected result:** Files should be identical (or differ only in dashboard-specific comments)

### 3. Shared Module Extraction (Future)

Consider creating shared Dash utilities after Epic 4 is complete:

```
packages/dash-shared/
├── auth_middleware.py
├── data_client.py
├── error_page.py
└── setup.py
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates code duplication
- Single source of truth for security-critical code
- Easier maintenance and updates

### 4. Testing Priority

**Priority 1 (Must Test):**
- JWT validation (all three stories)
- Tenant data isolation (especially Story 4.3 with both tenants)
- Data API integration (Stories 4.2 and 4.3)

**Priority 2 (Should Test):**
- Error handling (401, 404, 500)
- Token expiry (30 minute TTL)
- Data API failure scenarios

**Priority 3 (Nice to Test):**
- Performance under load
- Concurrent requests from multiple tenants
- Cache effectiveness (Story 4.1)
