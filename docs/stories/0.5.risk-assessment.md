# Story 0.5: External Dependency Risk Assessment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** a documented risk assessment of external dependencies,
**So that** the team understands fallback options if dependencies become unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `docs/external-dependencies.md` includes risk assessment section
2. For each external dependency (burn-performance, mixshift, test data), document:
   - Current availability status (accessible/inaccessible)
   - Criticality (critical/important/nice-to-have)
   - Fallback option if unavailable
   - Estimated effort to implement fallback
3. Document decision: Use actual repos or create stub Dash apps for PoC
4. If using stub apps, document simplified visualization plan (e.g., simple bar chart with mock data)
5. Update Epic 4 stories with confirmed approach (modify actual repos vs. create stub apps)
6. Product Owner sign-off on approach documented in risk assessment
7. Create `docs/assets/` directory structure for screenshots and reference materials

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Consolidate findings from Stories 0.1-0.3** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Review `docs/external-dependencies.md` from Stories 0.1-0.3
  - [ ] Extract availability status for:
    - burn-performance repository
    - mixshift repository
    - burn-performance-test-data
    - mixshift-test-data
  - [ ] Note any issues identified (missing repos, startup failures, data incompatibilities)

- [ ] **Task 2: Create risk assessment framework** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add "Risk Assessment" section to `docs/external-dependencies.md`
  - [ ] Create risk assessment table template:
    | Dependency | Availability | Criticality | Impact if Unavailable | Fallback Option | Estimated Effort |
    |------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
    | burn-performance repo | | | | | |
    | mixshift repo | | | | | |
    | burn-performance test data | | | | | |
    | mixshift test data | | | | | |

- [ ] **Task 3: Assess burn-performance repository** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] **Availability:** Accessible / Inaccessible (from Story 0.1)
  - [ ] **Criticality:** Critical (needed for CLV dashboard in Epic 4)
  - [ ] **Impact if Unavailable:** Epic 4, Story 4.2 blocked; cannot demonstrate real Dash integration
  - [ ] **Fallback Option:**
    - Option A: Acquire repository (contact owner, find public mirror)
    - Option B: Create stub CLV Dash app with simple bar chart visualization
  - [ ] **Estimated Effort:**
    - Option A: 4-8 hours (research, contact, acquire)
    - Option B: 8-12 hours (create stub app matching expected structure)

- [ ] **Task 4: Assess mixshift repository** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] **Availability:** Accessible / Inaccessible (from Story 0.1)
  - [ ] **Criticality:** Critical (needed for Risk dashboard in Epic 4)
  - [ ] **Impact if Unavailable:** Epic 4, Story 4.3 blocked; cannot demonstrate real Dash integration
  - [ ] **Fallback Option:**
    - Option A: Acquire repository
    - Option B: Create stub Risk Analysis Dash app with simple scatter plot or heatmap
  - [ ] **Estimated Effort:**
    - Option A: 4-8 hours
    - Option B: 8-12 hours

- [ ] **Task 5: Assess test data availability** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] **burn-performance test data:**
    - Availability: Accessible / Inaccessible (from Story 0.2)
    - Criticality: Important (can create synthetic if needed)
    - Fallback: Generate synthetic CLV data (50-100 rows)
    - Effort: 4 hours
  - [ ] **mixshift test data:**
    - Availability: Accessible / Inaccessible (from Story 0.2)
    - Criticality: Important (can create synthetic if needed)
    - Fallback: Generate synthetic risk data (50-100 rows)
    - Effort: 4 hours

- [ ] **Task 6: Make recommendation and document decision** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add "Recommended Approach" section to `docs/external-dependencies.md`
  - [ ] Based on availability assessment, recommend:
    - **Scenario A:** Repos accessible → Use actual repos, modify in Epic 4
    - **Scenario B:** Repos inaccessible → Create stub Dash apps
  - [ ] If Scenario B (stub apps):
    - Document stub CLV app plan:
      - Simple bar chart: Customer segments vs CLV value
      - Dropdown filter: Time period
      - Mock data: 50 customers with CLV values $1K-$50K
    - Document stub Risk app plan:
      - Simple scatter plot: Risk score vs Impact
      - Heatmap: Risk categories
      - Mock data: 50 risk items across 5 categories
    - Note: Stub apps will still demonstrate JWT validation, tenant isolation, reverse proxy

- [ ] **Task 7: Get Product Owner approval** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add "Product Owner Approval" section to risk assessment
  - [ ] Present recommendation with:
    - Availability findings
    - Risk assessment
    - Recommended approach
    - Estimated effort for each option
    - Trade-offs (real apps vs. stub apps)
  - [ ] Document PO decision:
    - Approach approved: [Use actual repos / Create stub apps]
    - Rationale: [Why this approach chosen]
    - Sign-off: [PO name, date]

- [ ] **Task 8: Update Epic 4 stories** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] If decision is "Use actual repos":
    - Confirm Epic 4 stories 4.2 and 4.3 can proceed as written
    - Note: No changes needed
  - [ ] If decision is "Create stub apps":
    - Add note to Epic 4, Story 4.2: "Use stub CLV app instead of burn-performance"
    - Add note to Epic 4, Story 4.3: "Use stub Risk app instead of mixshift"
    - Update story acceptance criteria to reflect stub app requirements
    - Document stub app creation as prerequisite task in Epic 4

- [ ] **Task 9: Create assets directory structure** (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create directory: `docs/assets/`
  - [ ] Create subdirectory: `docs/assets/dash-baseline/` (for Story 0.3 screenshots)
  - [ ] Create subdirectory: `docs/assets/demo/` (for future demo screenshots in Epic 6)
  - [ ] Document directory structure in `docs/external-dependencies.md`

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This is **Story 0.5** - the final story in Epic 0 (Prerequisites & External Dependency Validation). This story synthesizes findings from Stories 0.1-0.3 and makes a Product Owner decision on approach.

**Dependencies:**
- Story 0.1: Repository accessibility findings
- Story 0.2: Test data availability findings
- Story 0.3: Dash app startup validation findings

**Epic 4 Impact:** This story determines the approach for Epic 4 Dash integration (actual repos vs. stub apps).

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 0.1:**
- Repository locations and accessibility status
- Dash app structure and entry points
- Initial fallback planning

**From Story 0.2:**
- Test data availability and compatibility
- Data schemas and tenant_id augmentation needs

**From Story 0.3:**
- Dash app startup success/failure
- Version compatibility issues
- Screenshots of working baseline (if successful)

### Risk Assessment Framework
[Source: epic-0-prerequisites-validation.md]

**Risk levels:**
- **Critical:** Blocks Epic 4; no workaround without significant effort
- **Important:** Delays Epic 4; workarounds available
- **Nice-to-have:** Doesn't block progress; cosmetic or optional

**Decision criteria:**
- Can we acquire repos within 1-2 days?
- Do stub apps demonstrate architecture validation goals?
- What's the effort trade-off (acquire vs. create)?

### Stub Dash App Requirements
[Source: prd/epic-4 + architecture/6-components.md]

If creating stub apps, they must:
- Use Dash 2.18+ framework
- Accept JWT from Authorization header (like real apps will)
- Query FastAPI data API (not load data directly)
- Render tenant-scoped data based on JWT tenant_id
- Demonstrate reverse proxy header injection pattern

**Minimal visualization types:**
- CLV: Bar chart or simple table
- Risk: Scatter plot or heatmap

**Mock data requirements:**
- 50-100 rows per dataset
- Include tenant_id column
- Distributed across Acme and Beta tenants

### Product Owner Decision Point
[Source: epic-0-prerequisites-validation.md#story-0.5]

PO must approve:
1. Risk assessment accuracy
2. Recommended approach (actual repos vs. stubs)
3. Estimated effort for chosen approach
4. Impact on Epic 4 timeline

**Sign-off required before Epic 1 begins.**

### Epic 4 Story Updates
[Source: prd/epic-4-dash-application-integration.md]

If stub app approach chosen:
- **Story 4.1:** Still prepares tenant data (unchanged)
- **Story 4.2:** Changes to "Create stub CLV Dash app" instead of "Modify burn-performance"
- **Story 4.3:** Changes to "Create stub Risk Dash app" instead of "Modify mixshift"

Note: Stub app approach still validates core architecture (JWT, tenant isolation, reverse proxy).

### Directory Structure
[Source: architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md + epic-0 additions]

Assets directory structure (AC #7):
```
kyros-saas-poc/
├── docs/
│   └── assets/

│       └── demo/                   # Future Epic 6 demo materials
│           └── (screenshots from final demo)
```

### Testing
[Source: architecture/15-testing-strategy.md]

**No automated tests required** - this is a documentation and decision-making task.

**Manual validation:**
- Risk assessment covers all dependencies
- Effort estimates are reasonable
- Recommendation is clearly justified
- PO approval documented

**Definition of Done:**
- Risk assessment complete
- Approach decision documented
- Product Owner approval received
- Epic 4 approach confirmed
- Assets directory structure created
